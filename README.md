# Emotion Detection from Images Using CNN

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting emotional states (such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.) from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project consists of a back-end API created with **FastAPI** for handling image input and predicting emotions, and a **Flutter** front-end for creating a user-friendly interface to interact with the API.

### Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Classifies emotional states from images using a trained CNN model.
- **REST API**: Developed using FastAPI for serving the model and handling requests.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile App**: Flutter is used for the front-end to create a cross-platform application that interacts with the API.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For building the emotion detection model and developing the API.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For implementing and training the CNN model.
- **FastAPI**: For building the REST API to serve the model.
- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application (Android).
